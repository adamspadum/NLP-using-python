# NLP Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a simple Python-based sentiment analysis tool that uses the `NLTK` library and `VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)` to analyze user-submitted text and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. It also provides sentiment scores for positive, negative, neutral, and compound aspects.

## Features
- **Text Input**: Users can input any sentence or paragraph for analysis.
- **Sentiment Scores**: The output displays scores for positive, negative, neutral, and a compound score to summarize the overall sentiment.
- **Simple Interpretation**: The program interprets the compound score to display the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
